Static testing vs Dynamic Tetsing note

Agenda: 

    1. What is static testing? 

        - What to test in Static testing? 
        - In which SDLC steps do people perform the Static testing? 
        - Who are the people perform the Static testing?
        - How to perform the Static testing? 
        - Is it Verification process or Validation process? 

    1.What is Dynamic testing? 

        - What to test in Dynamic testing? 
        - In which SDLC steps do people perform the Dynamic testing? 
        - Who are the people perform the Dynamic testing?
        - How to perform the Dynamic testing?
        - Is it Verification process or Validation process?  
----------------------
Review: 
What are the testing objects do we have? 
- documents
- Code 
- Software -> Fun, Non-Fun 


Who performs testing in SDLC? 

- everyone. 

----------------------------------


Software testing divided into 2 big categories: 

     1. Static testing 

     2. Dynamic tetsing 


- What to test in Static testing?

     - test object is : Documents 


- In which SDLC steps do people perform the Static testing? 

    - Req gathering & Design steps. 

- Who are the people perform the Static testing?

    - The business team members: PO, PM, BA
    - Designers

- How to perform the Static testing? How to test the documents? 

    - there are 3 ways/ methods/ meetings to test the documents. 

    1. Review : a informal meeting , 

          Individual review: just one person review the Doc
          group review: a group of people review the doc 

    2. Walkthrough: a formal meeting, the author of the doc will go through the doc, and the others will provide feedback 

    3. Inspection: the most formal. 

- Is it Verification process or Validation process? 
  
   - Static testing is a Verification process - creating a doc -> test it -> in 1st & 2nd steps of SDLC. 

-----------------
What is static testing? 

 - Static testing is testing the documents, it is done in the SDLC 1st & 2nd steps by manually. People perform static testing by Review, Walkthrough and Inspection. It is a Verification process. 


==========================
informal meeting: not planed ahead, not organized by any one 

formal meeting: announcements -> at least 24 hours before, with the zoom link/office number, agenda, attachments , 

==========================

1. What is Dynamic testing? 

        - What to test in Dynamic testing? 
            
            - Code and the software (Fun, Non-Fun)

        - In which SDLC steps do people perform the Dynamic testing?
             
            - Developing & Testing. / 3rd & 4th step of SDLC

        - Who are the people perform the Dynamic testing?

            - Developers, Functions testers ( QA/SDET), Performance testers, 
            - The client 
            - End users


        - How to perform the Dynamic testing?
           
           - by 3 testing types / ways / approaches 

                 - White box testing 
                 - Black box testing 
                 - Gray box testing  

        - Is it Verification process or Validation process? 

            - Testing the code & app -> Validation process. 
            - do by both manual & automatic ways.
