STLC

requirement analysis 
=====================
=> in agile, scrum (kanban) it is happening during the sprint 
=> our testing life cycle starts from Sprint Planning and lasts till Demo

there 2 kind of STLC 
1st 
- per release or even the application life 
- Test Architect, Test Manager analysis the whole requirement for the application  life cycle, or per release

2nd
- for tester
- requirement analysis starts at Sprint Planning 
- testers are reviewing USs and ACs to make sure they understand it
- testers make sure required test data is available 
(mock data means not real data and it is used for testing purpose)

Test Planning 
==========================
- test planning for release - this is done by QA Manager 
- what you have seen in pds it is release related 

- in sprint testers in the team, plan the testing
- Test Plan for each sprint is done by the team members (testers) of that dev team
- usually it is done in test management tool
- here we will learn jira xray
- how manual test coverage will be handled
- how much automation 
- which scenarios will go to smoke
- which scenarios will go to regression

=============================
Test Scenario - is description
Test Case has steps 

TS1 - User Logs in with valid credentials       - positive
TS2 - User can not login with invalid password  - negative
TS3 - User can not login with invalid username  - negative
TS4 - User can not login with empty password    - exceptional 


TC1 - User Logs in with valid credentials
Given user is in login page
When user enters valid username
And user enters valid password
And user click on login button
Then user should be able to see home page for that user

at work we use test management tools which helps us to create and store the test cases
==================================

test environment is created by devops team for us to use
we have to make sure that developers code deployed to test env
it is not our job to deploy developers code to test env
but we should be able to check and start testing after that 
each company has it is own way of deployment of the code 
companies use tools likes jenkins to handle deployments 

===========================================================

push happens between branches 
deployment happens between environments


before creating the defect
- rerun run the scenario 
- talk to another tester in the team
- talk to your developer 
- bring to stand up get BA's idea even needed PO's idea
