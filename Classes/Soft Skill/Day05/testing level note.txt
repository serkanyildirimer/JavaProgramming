Agenda: 

	1. What are the testing levels / Testing hierarchy?  
	2. What is Unit Testing? Who performs it? In which Environment? 
    3. What is Integration Testing? Who performs it? In which Environment? 
    4. What is System Testing? Who performs it? In which Environment?
	5. What is User Acceptance Testing (UAT)? Who performs it? In Which Environment? 

-----------------------------
Testing levels : 

    - Unit testing 
    - Integration testing 
    - System testing 
    - UAT - User Acceptance Testing

req: login function 

1.  Unit testing -> testing the small unit / individual module of the app from the code perspective. Also called module/component testing. 

    who : Developers 

    env : the dev env


2. Integration testing -> testing 2 or mroe modules of the application and see if they work together or not. 

   who: Developers 

        { in some companies, SDET can do integration testing. }

   Env: the dev env


do you have experience performing integration testing? 
- no, I do not have experience, in my project, our dev performed the integration testing.  but I am willing to learn it. 


canvas app: 
   unit test -> login 
   unit test -> file upload 
   unit test -> file download 
   unit test -> calendar 


   integration scenario -> teacher login -> upload java file -> download the file


    
Developers deploy their codes from the Dev to the QA env. 

3. System testing -> test the software as a whole project.

     Who: SDET/QA , Performance testers
     Env: in the QA/test env 

           System is divided into: 1. Functional testing 

                                       Who: SDET/QA
                                       env: in the QA/test env 

                                       QA1 -> login fun _UI
                                              logout
                                       QA2 -> file upload 
                                              file share


                                   2. Non-Functional testing 

                                       Who: Performance testers
                                       env: In the QA/test env 


4. UAT -> user acceptance testing 

      UAT is divided into 2 testing: 1. UAT - Alpha testing -> testers 

                                     2. UAT - Beta testing -> the client, end users


       env : the staging / pre-production env 

        The client -> "test" == manually "use" 

        UAT team -> testers - QAs 
        ex: login -> upload a file from UI -> if the file is in DB 

----------------------------------------


Asiya -> speaking, talking, teaching, giving lecture ...


a develoepr write code to develop a function : 
   
   - Dynamic, white box testing, unit testing - integration testing

a QA testing a function : 
  
   - Dynamic, gray box , system, Function, 

a manual tester test a func: 

  - Dynamic, black box , system, Function, 


a client testing the app: 
 
  - Dynamic - black box, UAT, Beta 

a UAT tester performing testing: 
  
  - Dynamic , gray box, UAT , Alpha 


========================================


req: 
QA1 -> users should be able to upload files_UI. 
 
QA2 -> upload files should be stored in the DB_DB. 

QA3 -> users should be able to uplaod files_API. 

function -> upload files

         UI testing -> button? link? type? message? emoji? file uplaod download ?
                      java - selenium, cucumber, junit, maven 

         DB testing -> data in the DB? 
                       SQL ->  java - JDBC, cucumber, junit, maven 

         API testing -> URL 
                        java - RestAssuredAPI, cucumber, junit, maven 


in the interview, you have to ask from the interviewer - their expectation from you for the role & responsibility. 

   - API tester

   - full-stack 


--------------------------
Cross-browser testing - > running 1 task with multiple browsers. 

users should be able to upload files_UI. 
 
  - code -> chrome 
         -> Firefox 
         -> safari
