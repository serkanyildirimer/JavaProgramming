Can you tell me how did you implemented Agile-Scrum in your team? 

- Scrum team & size: in my scrum team, I have ?? people - 1PO, 1SM, ??dev, ?QA
- Sprint cycle - 2 weeks 
- Scrum meetings: 

   1. Grooming: 1. The PO explains the US & AC to the dev team 
                2. The dev team assign points to the US based on the Fibonacci 
                    1,2,3,5,8,13,21 

   
   2. Sprint planning: 
      1. SM creates a sprint backlog (on Jira app, just click a button to do so)
      2. SM & the dev team calculated the team capacity 
      3. PO take/pull US from the PB to the SB based on the DOR list 
      4. SM starts the sprint & write our Sprint goal(on Jira app, just click a button to do so)


====================


Agenda: 

    - Sprint planning meeting 
    - Sprint Backlog 
    - Team Capacity 
    - DOR - Definition of Ready
     
===================

Grooming -> 1. The PO explains the US & AC to the dev team 
            2. The dev team assign points to the US based on the Fibonacci 
                 1,2,3,5,8,13,21 

              2 weeks sprint:1,2,3,5 --> small user stories 
                            8,13,21 -> Epic, big user stories. PO will break it down

      output: All the US that the PO prepare are given point

-------------------
Sprint planning meeting: 
    who? -> the dev team: developers & QAs
    time --> sprint starting day ~ ending date 
    what tasks? --> which exact user stories to complete? 
    goal? --> complete the US that the dev team select, demonstrate to the PO & the client in the demo meeting 


grooming        :at 10 am - 12 pm (1 hour - 2 hours)

Sprint planning : 2 pm - 3 pm (1 hour - 2 hours)

 input: The PO has explained the user stories
        The user stories are estimated. 


during the planning meeting: 

      1. SM creates a sprint backlog (on Jira app, just click a button to do so)
      2. SM & the dev team calculated the team capacity 
      3. PO take/pull US from the PB to the SB based on the DOR list 
      4. SM starts the sprint (on Jira app, just click a button to do so)

      
 sprint backlog(SB): Each sprint has a sprint backlog
                     SB is created by the SM 
                     SB will be listed with the exact user stories that the dev team promise to complete by at the end of the sprint



     2. SM helps the team to calculate - Team capacity 

Team capacity: dev team -> dev & qas total work availability in a sprint
        
             how many days does a dev team work on a sprint?
                     
                     (2 days are only for the meetings, 1st and last day)
              dev1 - 10 days in a sprint -> 8 days to work on US in a sprint 
              dev2 - 10 days in a sprint -> 8 days to work on US in a sprint 
              dev3 - 10 days in a sprint -> 8 days to work on US in a sprint 
              qa1  - 10 days in a sprint -> 8 days to work on US in a sprint 
              qa2  - 10 days in a sprint -> 8 days to work on US in a sprint 
            -------------------  total   -> 8+8+8+8+8= 40 -> team capacity 


         calculate team capacity for sprint 1 : holiday? 

          SM: Any one has any day off in this sprint? (03/01 -- 03/12)
              - anyone has any appointment so that he/she cannot work

                Vincent (Dev)     8
                Rahul (Dev)       8
                Aysel (Dev)       8
                Jessica (QA)      8
                Mustafa(QA)       7
                Team Capacity     39 -> sprint 1 

        What does 39 mean? how do we use that number in our planning? 

        Team capacity == total user story points that the team can work in the sprint. 


    3. the PO takes the user stories from the backlog to the sprint backlog

       - US are selected - priority 
                         - DOR: Definition of ready 


       DOR - list of condition that the Scrum team created
