Agenda: 

    - STLC - Test Closure step
        - RTM - Requirement Traceability Matrix 
          (Matrix means an arrangement of numbers/symbols in rows and columns)

    - Jira intro, Jira-Xray 

===============================

1. Test strategy doc - PM

2. Test plan doc - QA 

3. Test case doc : QA, scenario, env, steps, test data , expected result, 
                        actual result, test status : fail / pass, evidence: screenshot/videos 


4. Environment setup 

5. Test Execution : expected result vs actual result
                     

                     - bug life cycle: 
                     1. confirm it is a valid bug?  

                           - test with multiple data 
                           - test with multiple QA env
                           - Ask other QAs to check 
                           - Developers 

                      2. Bug report doc -> assign, opened: fixed / deferred, rejected:1. invalid bug 
                                                                                     2. duplicated
                      

6. Test Closure: 1 user story -> 1 or more TC -> 1 test execute -> pass/fails 
                 
                 DOD criteria: if all the possible tets cases are created? 1 TC - 1 AC
                               if each AC is tested or not? 
                               if any test case tested by manually ? automatically ? both? 
                                  manual -> test case ticket on jira is created + test execution ticket is created + test status (fail/pass)
                               if there was a bug, what is the bug status? 


               Sprint level: test closure report --> RTM 

                  ex: sprint23 --> 12 user stories -> how many TC?
                                                      12 Test Execution -> test staus? 
                                                      how many bug reports?
