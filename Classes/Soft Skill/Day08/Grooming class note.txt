Agenda: 

   - Grooming meeting 
        - when to conduct? who joins the meeting? what to do? 

   - User Story point estimation 

=================

Review Scrum

Agile -> software method, set of rule
         
         - customer sanctification 
         - team work -> face to face communication 
         - work small part of the app at a time
         - release the app in a short cycle

         Agile Branches / Framework / types: 

            - Scrum -> Scrum team + roles(3)
            - Kanban
            - XP
            - Lean 

--------------------

 What is Scrum? How did you use/implemented the Scrum in your proect? 

   - Scrum team -> Scrum 3 roles: 1 PO, 1 SM, Dev team(Developers & QAs)

     real work, the team members might be different: 

        - BA -> helper for the PO
        - performance tester
        - designers 

        QA1 -> 1 po, 1 SM, 4dev, 2QA
        QA2 -> 1 po, 1 SM, 1 BA, 5dev, 3QA
        QA3 -> 1 po, 1 SM, 1 performance tester, 4dev, 3QA
        QA4 -> 1po, 1ba, 1sm, 4dev, 4qas, 1 designer, 2 performances

   - Scrum artifacts -> important key words, documents, result

        - Product backlog, Sprint backlog, product Increment, Burn down chart

        Product backlog: is a place/document, list of to do user stories 
                          Jira -> project management app 
                          PO manages the PB -> prioritize the user stories 
                          1 - 2 sprint's user stories are listed ay a time. 

        product Increment: completed tasks - US/bugs 


   - Scrum meetings -> 5 meetings 


Sprint -> 1 week --> 4 weeks, 
          2 weeks is the most common cycle. 

          1 sprint ==  2 weeks == 15 business days  



user stories: client's requirement
  
   client- i want students are able to watch recordigs
  
   PO -> 
   User Story: 
     As a user, I want to watch recordings so that I can review the classes.

   Acceptance Criteria: Accept, Criteria: 
    1. teachers should be able to upload zoom recordings 
    2. students only can watch 
    3. users should be able to stop a recording by clicking "STOP" button 
---------------------------------------

Scrum meeting: 1. Grooming meeting 


before the grooming -> PO has to prepare US under the backlog 
                       US are prioritized 


at the meeting: 1. PO explains the US to the dev team 
                
                - the PO opens one US -> explains the US & AC 
                - devs & qas -> PO will answer

                2. Estimate point 

                - Developers & testers estimate points based on the Fibonacci 

output of the grooming -> US are clarified by the PO, & each user story is estimated.             
======================

estimate user story: 


companies has a rule: 
1. effort -> write code, write test case time 
2. knowledge + experience -> work on the similar user stoy 
3. complexity level -> easy, medium, hard 

Fibonacci number 

  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21


  1 point = 1 day 

  login --> 1 day --> 1 point 
  file upload -> 3 days --> 3 points 

interview question-> 
can you assign number 7 to a user story? 
- no, we only assign points that is appeared in the Fibonacci system

   1 sprint == 2 weeks == 10 days --> 8 days to work on users tories: 

         User sorties -> are all small enough to complete within the sprint

         1,2,3,5 --> only these are small 
         8,13,21 --> they are epci (Epic is a big user story) 


   1 sprint == 3 weeks == 15 days 

   1 sprint == 4 weeks == 20 days

==================

estimate rule #1: 

1 point = 1 day
login -> 

     dev1 -> 3 days -> 3 points
     dev2 -> 2 days -> 2 points
     dev3 -> 5 days -> 5 points

     The po -> ask the lowest point & highest points to explain the reason
           
       after the discussion, the will vote again.

       3 points==> developers 3 days      
         

     qa1 -> 1 day -> 1 point 
     qa2 -> 2 days -> 2 points

    The po -> ask the lowest point & highest points to explain the reason
       
       1 point --> 1 day to test. 


    dev-> 3 point  QA -> 1 point  ==> 3+1 = 4?  --> 5 points
------------

rule #2 

1 point = 1 day both developing & testing 

     dev1 -> 5 points -> 5 days to develop & test  
     dev2 -> 5 points
     dev3 -> 5 points
     qa1  -> 3 points 
     qa2  -> 5 points 

-------------------
rule #3 

   
Sprint 1 -> 12 User stories --> only will be worked by the developers
                                   QAs -> prepare itellij project,preparation

Sprint 2 -> 
12 User stories from the Sprint 1 -> QAs will test, estimate points  

7 new user stories for the developers-> developers estimate points


Sprint 3 -> 
7 User stories from Sprint 2 -> QA will estimate point & work

9 new stories for the devs -> devs will estimate points
