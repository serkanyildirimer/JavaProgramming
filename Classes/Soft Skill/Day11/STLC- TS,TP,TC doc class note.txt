Agenda: 

    STCL - Software Testing Life Cycle

    What is a Test strategy? who writes? 
          - it is a doc -> prepared by PM. 

    What is a Test Plan? who writes? How often?
          - it is a doc, prepared by a QA (QAs contribute in a meeting)

    What is a test case? how to write a test case doc? 

=================

step1: req analyze 


Business team -> inform the QAs about which feature to test for the release. 

             EX: PO,PM -> release cycle : 2 months, release v1.0-> 11/15th 

                 login page + homepage dashboard features.
                   - login feature
                   - logout features
                   - To Do list features


req analyze == understand which features to test? 
               perform which types of testing? --> UI/DB/API testings,
                [ types of testings == testing scope] 
               Environments? 
               which testing tools will be used?  

1 - way: verbally delivers --> during the meeting, PM explains & takes Q. 

2 - way: PM write a "test Strategy" document + expains in the meeting. 

3 - way: Business team + QAs conduct a meeting 
         PM explains & takes Q 
         PM provides a test strategy templete doc
         QA lead / senior QA -> take a note -> after the meeting write the doc
         in this case -> PM , PO can approve the doc

===============================

2. test plan 


QAs conduct a meeting -> test plan doc 

QA lead / any QA write the Test Plan doc 
         -> Business team provides template 
         -> whoever responsible for the doc, take a note during the meeting
         -> write the test plan 
         -> approval -> PM/PO/QA lead

   08/25 -> test plan doc -> release v1.0 :09/04 -- 11/25

   11/26 -> test plan doc -> release v2.0: 11/26 -- 02/15 


 What is a Test Plan? who writes? How often?

 - test plan is a doc -> which has project info, feature descriotion
                         role & responsibilities 
                         schedule 
                         testing strategy -> testing types / tools / env 
                         risk & mitigation 
                         approves 


- who writes test plan ? -> QAs / QA lead 


- How often? -> one test plan for one release


================================

login -> tc01, tc02

logout -> tc03 

file upload -> tc04, tc05 ...


=======================

Step 3: test case(TC) creation 


QAs write a TC/s based on 1 user story. 

How many TC should I wrote for 1 user story? 

- the best way is : 1 TC for 1 AC. 


Test case types? 
- Happy/Positive test case --> test a function with valid data, 
                               test how it should respond 

- negative test case --> test a function with INVALID data, or no data


what is a (test) scenario? 
- scenario is one sentence --> what to test? 
                               EX:test/check/verify login function with valid data
                                  test users upload files

what is a test case? 

- test case is a document --> How to test? 
   ID, Scenario, env, steps, data, expected & actual result, test status(pass/fail)

  
EX: 

manual test case: 

ID: test case 01 
sceanrio: login with valid data 
Environment:
steps:   
    
    user go to the login page
    enter username
    enter password
    click login button 

expected result: login successfully

====================================

Cucumber test case: written with Gherkin language: Given, When, And, Then 

   scenario: login with valid data 

       Given user on the login page
       When user enter username
       And user enter password
       And user enter login button
       Then user login successfully

=============================


users -> students: login -> logout -> room availability m schedule
     
         team lead -> book rooms 

         teachers - book rooms

=====================

In Jira: 

Test == Test case 

Summary in Test ticket == scenario 

Assignee == who will take care of this issue

issue == document == ticket

====================

as long as your US is not relates to any function on the login page, your test cases 1st step do not start with "user go to login page".
