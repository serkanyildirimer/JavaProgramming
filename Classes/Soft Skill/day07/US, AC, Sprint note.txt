Software method - rule in the IT company 

waterfall: traditional method
           step by step method , there is no going back to the previous step 
           small project -> clear req at the beginning of the SDLC


Agile: wildly used among the IT companies now days 
       manifesto = 4 values + 12 principles 


Agile - Scrum - the most used agile framework/branch 


What is Scrum? 
    
     -  3 roles in Scrum team
     -  3 Scrum Artifacts(important information)
     -  5 Scrum meetings 

=====================

Scrum team has 3 roles: 
         
         1. PO -> 1 po for one project 

              PO is the voice of the Client, represent the client
              PO gets the req from the client
              PO writes User Stories and Acceptance Criterias
              PO manage and prioritize the Product backlog

         2. Dev team = Developers + QAs,  several devs & QAs,  2-3Dev : 1 QA

         3. SM -> Scrum Master, 1 SM for one project

                  SM is not a technical person
                  SM is a helper to the team to arrange meetings 
                  SM is a coach / guide the team with the correct definition in the meeting


==========================

Sprint : running for a short distance 


 1 sprint = 1 week 
            2 weeks --> the most common 
            3 weeks 
            4 weeks

In the Agile-Scrum team, who decides what is gonna be the sprint length/cycle? 

 - All the Scrum members decide together

      1 po - release cycle is 2/3 months 
      1 sm 
      4 dev 
      2 qa 

 Sprint cycle will NOT change after its decided. 
 Sprint can be started any date, the common ones are: Weds, and Thur 
 Each sprint has a unique number


1 sprint =  2 weeks  

1 month   = 4 weeks  = 2 sprint 
12 months = 52 weeks = 21 - 24 sprints 


Ali -> Amazon for 2 years, right now we are at Sprint 48 
==========================================

Product Increment = DONE tasks at the end of each sprint is called product Increment


==========================================

User Story 


Business team gather req -> all the req are listed in the SRS document. 

In waterfall, PO writes the req.
              Req are listed in SRS document


In agile, Requirements are called User Story. 

In Scrum, PO writes the User Story
          User Stories are listed under the Product Backlog.        


How we can say if a User Story is good or bad? 
 - meet the INVEST criteria , good user story


Product Backlog -->  list of User stories.
                     managed by the PO
                     just one product backlog for one project 
                     Product backlog is prioritized by the PO
                     The PO writes 1 - 2 sprints User Stories
                     Product backlog constantlly updated 

====================
Epic: 

User Stories should be small --> small enough to complete in one sprint. 

 As a user, I want to create a new quiz. 8 days 
 As a user, I want to delete a quiz. 2 days

 As a user, I want to watch a recording. 13 days 
     --> not a small US
     --> we call the big user stories as Epic
     --> when devs & qas agree that one US is an Epic, PO will break it down to the small user stories. 

     As a user, I want to watch a recording --> Epic

        - As a user, I want to start a recording to watch. 2 days
        - As a user, I want to stop a recording while i am watching. 8 days
        - As a user, I want to ajduest the speed of the recording. 3 days
  
=======================================
